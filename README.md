My application to Auphan Software
Built upon the following guidelines:

1. Has a place for the username, password and a login button.
2. The username, password and login button are placed inside a box and centered horizontally and vertically in the page.   
3. Use CSS classes, no use of style attributes.
4. Uses ajax to submit the username and password for verification.
5. If the username submitted is {redacted} and password is {redacted}, 
   then show a message saying "Login Successful." 
   otherwise, flash a message showing "Incorrect Username/Password".
6. If the username is not an email prevent the user from pressing login.
7. The page should look decent.  (Perhaps rounded corners, background image/color, drop shadows... it's up to you.)
8. Be in one file. (Easier for us to review your work.)
